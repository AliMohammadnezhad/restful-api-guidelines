[[deprecation]]
= Deprecation

Sometimes it is necessary to phase out an API endpoint (or version), for
instance, if a field is no longer supported in the result or a whole business
functionality behind an endpoint has to be shut down. There are many other
reasons as well. As long as these endpoints are still used by consumers these
are breaking changes and not allowed. Deprecation rules have to be applied to
make sure that necessary consumer changes are aligned and deprecated endpoints
are not used before API changes are deployed. 


[#185]
== {MUST} obtain approval of clients

Before shutting down an API (or version of an API) the producer must
make sure, that all clients have given their consent to shut down the
endpoint. Producers should help consumers to migrate to a potential new
endpoint (i.e. by providing a migration manual). After all clients are
migrated, the producer may shut down the deprecated API.


[#186]
== {MUST} external partners must agree on deprecation time span

If the API is consumed by any external partner, the producer must define
a reasonable time span that the API will be maintained after the producer
has announced deprecation. The external partner (client) must agree to
this minimum after-deprecation-life-span before he starts using the API.


[#187]
== {MUST} reflect deprecation in API specifications

API deprecation must be part of the Open API definition. If a method on a
path, a whole path or even a whole API endpoint (multiple paths) should be
deprecated, the producers must set `deprecated=true` on each method/path-
element that will be deprecated (Open API 2.0 only allows you to define
deprecation on this level). If deprecation should happen on a more fine
grained level (i.e. query parameter, payload etc.), the producer should set
`deprecated=true` on the affected method / path element and add further
explanation to the `description` section.

If `deprecated` is set to `true`, the producer must describe what clients
should use instead and when the API will be shut down in the `description`
section of the API definition.


[#188]
== {MUST} monitor usage of deprecated APIs and API endpoints

Owners of APIs used in production must monitor usage of deprecated APIs
until the API can be shut down in order to align deprecation and avoid
uncontrolled breaking effects. See also the <<193>>.


[#189]
== {SHOULD} add a warning header to responses

During deprecation phase, the producer should add a `Warning` header (see
{RFC-7234}#section-5.5[RFC 7234 - Warning header]) field. When adding the
`Warning` header, the `warn-code` must be `299` and the `warn-text` should be
in form of 

[source,txt]
----
The path/operation/parameter/... {name} is deprecated and will be removed by {date}.
Please see {link} for details.
----

with a link to a documentation describing why the API is no longer supported
in the current form and what clients should do about it. Adding the `Warning`
header is not sufficient to gain client consent to shut down an API.


[#190]
== {SHOULD} add monitoring for warning header

Clients should monitor the `Warning` header in HTTP responses to see if
an API will be deprecated in future.


[#191]
== {MUST} not start using deprecated APIs

Clients must not start using deprecated parts of an API.
