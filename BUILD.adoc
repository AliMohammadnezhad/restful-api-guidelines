It uses https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec[watchexec] to watch for
changes in the `.adoc` (and `.css`) files to rebuild the html on save.

== Generate Custom CSS

In order to generate custom CSS we have to use http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#stylesheet-factory[`stylesheet-factory`]

This script clones the factory repository, installs the dependencies and generates CSS based in the `zalando.scss`

[source,bash]
